## Day 1 – Why LangGraph?

This project is part of a 30-day journey into **Agentic AI systems**.

Day 1 focuses on understanding **why chains break** and why
graph-based orchestration (LangGraph) is essential for:

- long-running workflows
- retries & error handling
- conditional execution
- multi-agent systems

Today’s output:
- Minimal LangGraph setup
- First executable graph
- Foundation for future agents
